## Film Query Project

### Week 7 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

##### The challenge in this project was to link a database to a java application and to be able to pull out information from that database and display the search results that the user has requested.

### Steps Of The Application

##### Starting off, the user is presented with a menu screen and from there the user has three option. First option: prompts the user to enter a film number. The user then enters a number and the program pulls information out of the database that corresponds with inputed number and displays the film and its characteristics as well as all of the actors that were in the film. If nothing was found or the user had an incorrect input, it will display an error message and prompt the user to try again. If successful, the user is brought back to the menu. Second option: prompts the user to enter a search input and from there the application will look for a title or a description that contains the input anywhere inside of it. Once there is an input, the application will pull out every movie that it matches with and will bring the user back to the menu. If nothing is found, the user tries again. Third option: exits the application.

### Lessons Learned

##### Databases at this point in time are new to me and working with them was a step, but having the database connect to my Java application was the leap. At the beginning it was a scary project being so new to databases but was very rewarding after fighting with it to get it to work and it really is humbling to know how many steps there are to create a program that really only allows the user to do limited things and that alone gets me excited to be working on bigger projects!




### New Technologies/Topics Applied
